## Project Overview
This project provides a web-based application for predicting car prices using machine learning models. Users can interact with the model and view predictions in real-time through a user-friendly interface built using streamlit framework.

## Features

### Data Collection
- **Historical Car Data**: Collects data on car prices, features, and specifications from various sources including APIs and web scraping.
- **Real-time Data**: Allows users to input current car details for instant price predictions.

### Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, removes outliers, and corrects inconsistencies in the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates and selects relevant features such as car make, model, year, mileage, engine size, and other attributes.
- **Normalization/Standardization**: Scales numerical features to ensure they are on a comparable scale for better model performance.

### Model Training
- **Algorithm Selection**: Utilizes machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting Machines.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizes model parameters for improved accuracy and performance.
- **Cross-validation**: Uses techniques like k-fold cross-validation to validate the model's performance.

### Prediction
- **Price Estimation**: Generates predictions for car prices based on user inputs or historical data.
- **Confidence Intervals**: Optionally provides confidence intervals or prediction ranges to indicate the reliability of the predictions.

### Web Interface
- **User Input Form**: Allows users to input car details including make, model, year, mileage, and other features.
- **Prediction Display**: Shows the predicted car price in a user-friendly format.


### Visualization
- **Price Distribution**: Displays charts showing the distribution of car prices across different makes, models, and years.
- **Feature Impact**: Visualizes how different features (e.g., mileage, year) affect car prices using plots like feature importance or partial dependence plots.
- **Model Performance**: Shows metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or R-squared values to convey the modelâ€™s accuracy.


## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis and web application development.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning algorithms and tools.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Flask/Django/Streamlit**: Web framework for building the user interface.
- **APIs/yfinance**: For fetching real-time stock data.
