## Project Overview
This project provides a web-based application for predicting car prices using machine learning models. Users can interact with the model and view predictions in real-time through a user-friendly interface built using streamlit framework.


## Features

- **Custom UI Styling**: 
  - The interface is enhanced with custom CSS for a modern, polished appearance.
  - Styled buttons and select boxes for an intuitive user experience.
  
- **Title Banner**: 
  - A visually appealing banner that displays the title "Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning" with gradient styling.
  
- **Introductory Text**: 
  - Brief and user-friendly explanation to guide sellers in estimating the value of their car.

- **User Input Fields**:
  - `Ex-showroom price`: Input for the car's original price (in Lakhs).
  - `Distance driven`: Input for kilometers driven by the car.
  - `Fuel type`: Choose between Petrol, Diesel, or CNG.
  - `Seller type`: Select whether you're a dealer or an individual.
  - `Transmission type`: Choose between Manual or Automatic transmission.
  - `Previous owners`: Select the number of previous owners.
  - `Year of purchase`: Enter the year of car purchase, and the app calculates the car's age.

- **Prediction Button**: 
  - A "Predict Car Price" button triggers the machine learning model to estimate the carâ€™s price.

- **Machine Learning Model**:
  - The app uses an XGBoost regression model to predict the car's price based on the provided inputs.

- **Result Display**: 
  - The predicted price is displayed in a user-friendly format. If the prediction is successful, celebratory balloons are shown.
  
- **Error Handling**: 
  - If something goes wrong with the input or prediction, users are notified with an error message for correction.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis and web application development.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning algorithms and tools.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Flask/Django/Streamlit**: Web framework for building the user interface.
- **APIs/yfinance**: For fetching real-time stock data.
